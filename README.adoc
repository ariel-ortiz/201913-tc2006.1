This project contains all the source files that the course instructor will be writing in class during the 2019 August-December semester.

You can inspect the files directly through this site, or you can use `git` to obtain a local copy of these. In the latter case, you must do the following:

1. If necessary, http://git-scm.com/downloads[install a git client] in your computer.
 
2. Clone this repository. Type at the terminal:
    
    git clone https://github.com/ariel-ortiz/201913-tc2006.1.git tc2006
    
 3. Change your current working directory to `tc2006`:

    cd tc2006
+
You will find all the project source files under this directory.

4. Every time the instructor updates an existing file or creates a new one, you will need to run the repository *pull* command. Type at the terminal from within the `tc2006` directory:
    
    git pull
